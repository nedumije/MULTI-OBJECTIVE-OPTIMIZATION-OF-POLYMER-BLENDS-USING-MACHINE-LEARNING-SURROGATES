# MULTI-OBJECTIVE-OPTIMIZATION-OF-POLYMER-BLENDS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-SURROGATES


BACKGROUND OF STUDY


Polymer blends are formed by combining two or more polymers, are critical in materials science due to their ability to deliver tailored properties for applications ranging from packaging and automotive components to biomedical devices. However, designing polymer blends involves navigating a complex trade-off between performance metrics, such as mechanical strength, thermal stability, and cost-effectiveness. Traditional experimental approaches to polymer blend optimization rely on trial-and-error, requiring extensive laboratory testing that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive.Recent advancements in computational materials science have introduced data-driven methods to accelerate materials discovery. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships between material compositions and their properties, enabling the creation of surrogate models that predict outcomes without physical experiments. Concurrently, multi-objective optimization techniques, such as the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), allow researchers to identify optimal trade-offs between conflicting objectives, such as maximizing quality while minimizing cost.Despite these advances, integrating ML surrogates with multi-objective optimization for polymer blend design remains underexplored. Challenges include handling high-dimensional datasets, ensuring model accuracy across diverse blend formulations, and generating actionable insights from optimization results. This project addresses these challenges by developing a robust framework that combines ML-based surrogate modeling with NSGA-II to optimize polymer blends efficiently. By utilizing a large dataset of 120,000 experimental records, this work demonstrates a scalable, data-driven approach to materials design, offering significant potential for reducing development costs and accelerating innovation in polymer science. 


PROJECT OVERVIEW


This repository presents a data-driven framework for multi-objective optimization of polymer blends using machine learning surrogate models. The primary goal is to identify optimal polymer blend formulations that balance two competing objectives: maximizing the Quality Score (a normalized performance metric) and minimizing Material Cost (in USD/kg).By employing ML surrogates, the framework replaces costly physical experiments with rapid, accurate predictions, enabling efficient exploration of the design space. The workflow, implemented in a Jupyter notebook, encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, multi-objective optimization, and result analysis.

METHODOLOGY

A. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The workflow begins with the polymer_blend_dataset.csv dataset, comprising 120,000 entries and 47 features, including numerical (e.g., composition ratios, processing conditions) and categorical (e.g., additive types) variables.

B. Data Cleaning:

I. Missing values in the additive_type column are imputed with 'Unknown' to preserve data integrity.

II. Numerical features are checked for outliers and normalized where necessary to ensure model robustness.

III. Categorical features are encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding) for compatibility with ML algorithms.


EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS


EDA is conducted to understand feature distributions and relationships:

A. Numerical Features: Histograms and kernel density plots visualize distributions of key variables like quality_score_0_1 and material_cost_usd_kg.

B. Categorical Features: Count plots display the frequency of categories in additive_type.

C. Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix identifies relationships between input features and target variables, guiding feature selection.


MACHINE LEARNING SURROGATE MODELS

Two ML models are trained as surrogates for physical experiments:

A. Quality Score Model: A regression model (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) predicts quality_score_0_1 based on input features.

B. Material Cost Model: A separate regression model predicts material_cost_usd_kg using the same input features.

MODEL TRAINING

A. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

B. Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using grid search or random search) optimizes model performance.

C. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² evaluate model accuracy.


MULTI OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION

The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the two objectives:

A. Objective 1: Maximize quality_score_0_1 (predicted by the quality model).

B. Objective 2: Minimize material_cost_usd_kg (predicted by the cost model).

OPTIMIZATION SETUP

A. Population Size: 100 individuals.

B. Generations: 50 iterations.

C. Constraints: Input parameters are bounded within realistic ranges (e.g., composition ratios between 0 and 1).

The algorithm generates a Pareto front, a set of non-dominated solutions representing optimal trade-offs.


RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

The optimization produces a Pareto front of candidate solutions, each representing a unique polymer blend formulation. Key findings include:

A. Diverse Trade-offs: Solutions range from high-quality, high-cost blends to low-cost, moderate-quality blends.

B. Example Solution: One formulation achieves a quality score of 0.6812 at a cost of 0.7426 USD/kg.

C. Visualization: A scatter plot of the Pareto front illustrates the trade-off between quality and cost, aiding decision-making.


KEY RESULTS
 
A. Efficient Design Exploration: 

ML surrogates enable rapid evaluation of thousands of blend formulations, reducing reliance on physical experiments.

B. Optimal Trade-offs: 

The Pareto front provides a diverse set of solutions, allowing stakeholders to prioritize quality or cost based on application needs.

C. Scalable Framework: 

The approach is adaptable to other materials design problems with multi-objective requirements.


CONCLUSION

This project presents a robust framework for optimizing polymer blend formulations by integrating machine learning surrogate models with multi-objective optimization, achieving an effective balance between quality and cost. By replacing resource-intensive physical experiments with predictive models and employing the NSGA-II algorithm, the workflow identifies a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions tailored to specific application needs. The approach demonstrates significant potential for accelerating materials development, offering a scalable and efficient methodology that can be adapted to other complex materials design challenges, ultimately advancing innovation in polymer science.
